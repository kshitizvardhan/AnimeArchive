# Anime Archive

Welcome to the Anime Archive project! This repository showcases a collection of popular animes, built using Next.js. This project marks my initial exploration with Next.js, focusing on implementing key features such as infinite scroll and utilizing Server Actions effectively.

## Key Features

- **Next.js Framework**: Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR).
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implementing infinite scrolling to seamlessly load more content as users scroll.
- **Server Actions**: Learning and applying Server Actions in Next.js to fetch data on both server-rendered and client-rendered pages.
- **Framer Motion**: Enhancing server-side rendered pages with Framer Motion for fluid animations and transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for React applications that enables SSR and CSR.
- **Framer Motion**: Library for creating animations and gestures in React applications.

## Key Concepts Learned

### Next.js

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Utilizing Next.js to render pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Leveraging Next.js for dynamic client-side rendering when required.
- **Server Actions**: Implementing server actions to fetch data asynchronously and efficiently on both server-rendered and client-rendered pages.
- **Framer Motion**: Integrating Framer Motion for animating components and creating smooth transitions, enhancing user experience on server-side rendered pages.

Thank you for exploring the Anime Archive project! This project has equipped me with valuable insights into Next.js, server-side rendering, client-side rendering, and utilizing Framer Motion for animations. I look forward to applying these learnings to create more dynamic and interactive web applications.
